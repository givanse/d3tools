## How to use
 * Click on the names of the monsters to mark or un-mark them as done.
 * Use the checkboxes at the top to hide or un-hide different sections.

## Source code
The code has to be in a single file and it is long. If you want to directly edit the HTML/Javascript I recommend that you use the editor [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) or an advanced editor like VIM.
